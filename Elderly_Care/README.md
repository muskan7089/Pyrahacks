**Elderly Care Network Project**

**Description:**
The Elderly Care Network project is a web application aimed at connecting elderly individuals with volunteers who can assist them with various tasks based on their preferences and availability. The project provides a platform for elderly individuals to register their profiles and preferences, and it matches them with suitable volunteers who are willing to help.

**Features:**
1. **Elderly Registration:** Elderly users can register by providing their name, email, phone number, availability on specific days, and preferences for assistance (e.g., running errands, companionship).

2. **Volunteer Matching:** The project has a list of pre-defined volunteer profiles with their availability and preferences. When an elderly user registers, the application matches them with suitable volunteers who have the same preferences.

3. **Matched Volunteers Display:** After registration, the application displays a list of matched volunteers who have the same preferences as the registered elderly user.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the "index.html" file in your web browser.
3. Fill out the elderly registration form with your details, availability, and preferences.
4. Click the "Register as Elderly" button to submit the form.
