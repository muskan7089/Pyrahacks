            <h1>Chemical Recycling for Plastic Waste</h1>
            <p>Chemical recycling, also known as advanced or tertiary recycling, is a process that breaks down plastic waste into its basic chemical components, allowing them to be reused in the production of new plastic materials or other valuable products. Unlike traditional mechanical recycling, which involves melting and reshaping plastics, chemical recycling focuses on depolymerizing plastics into monomers or converting them into feedstock for various chemical processes..</p>

            <h2>Benefits of chemical recycling</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
<li> <strong>Reduction of Plastic Waste:</strong> Chemical recycling offers a way to manage plastic waste that is difficult to recycle through traditional mechanical recycling methods. It can help divert more plastics from landfills and oceans, thus reducing environmental pollution.
                </li>
<li><strong>Resource Recovery:</strong> Chemical recycling allows the recovery of valuable resources from plastic waste, which can be used to produce new plastics or other high-value products.</li>

<li><strong>Enhanced Sustainability:</strong> By converting plastic waste into useful chemicals and feedstock, chemical recycling contributes to a more sustainable and circular economy, reducing the dependence on fossil fuels for the production of new plastics.</li>

<li><strong>Addressing Difficult-to-Recycle Plastics:</strong> Chemical recycling can handle mixed or contaminated plastics that are challenging to recycle through conventional methods, broadening the range of recyclable plastics.</li>
</ul>
